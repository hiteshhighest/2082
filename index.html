        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem; font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">Dear Manavi,</span>
        <div>
            <br>
            After the break up, I have realized how much I loved you and how badly I treated you. Last year wasn‚Äôt perfect, I hurt you, disappointed you, and maybe even made you doubt my love. But I have been improving, learning, and trying to change every day since.
            <br><br>
            This website is a tiny gift which I made using my emotions and love for you. It‚Äôs not much and neither expensive, but it carries my most sincere feelings. ‚ù§Ô∏è
            <br><br>
            It hurts how we are getting seprated and we won't be in the same school after a few months. Even if we get seprated, I‚Äôll never forget the happiness you brought into my life. Thank you for every laughter, every lesson, and every memory. I will always enjoy and love them.
            <br><br>
            Let‚Äôs make this year special. A new beginning, maybe for us, too.
